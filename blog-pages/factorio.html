                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    Factorio is a base-management, simulation game in which players, controlling a character known as “The Engineer”, find themselves
                    crash-landed on an unfamiliar planet. They have no resources besides those available to them in this unknown world. Using these
                    resources, the player must use the Engineer’s knowledge and technical prowess to eventually create a rocket that will deliver them
                    safely from the planet back home. The new world has vast resources, including iron, wood, copper, stone, and coal. Initially, they
                    can be used to create rudimentary machines. Drills can be made, powered by fuel to extract resources from the land. Furnaces can
                    be made, which are used to process certain items, like iron ore, into more valuable ones, like iron plates. Conveyor belts can be
                    made, which are used to transport resources from certain parts of the world to the other. As the player amasses and processes more
                    and more resources, they can develop laboratories to research new technologies that make their production and processing more
                    efficient. The core of the gameplay of Factorio involves developing more machines and more efficient production to support more
                    research to build more efficient machines to support more research and so on. Eventually, the player will get to a point where
                    they can develop a rocket that will allow them to leave the planet, winning the game. However, as players progress, the machines
                    they create will emit more and more pollution. At the beginning of the game, when first developing the factory, players have no
                    choice but to use polluting machines. The pollution emitted by the player spreads across the land as it grows more and more. While
                    the trees and plant life in the game can remove pollution from the air, it is at a minuscule rate compared to the rate of
                    emissions from the machinery. The planet has a variety of indigenous life living in a collection of nests spread across the land
                    and emissions will become a big issue for the player as they progress. When pollution spreads from the machinery in the factory
                    and reaches the nests, it aggravates the indigenous life and prompts attacks on the factory. The only ways to cease the attacks
                    from the indigenous population is to either destroy their nests to keep them from reproducing or stop polluting the planet. The
                    indigenous threat grows proportionally to the polluted air that reaches their nests. So, the gameplay involves expanding and
                    enhancing your production while managing the threat of indigenous life.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Gameplay and Growth</h4>
                <p>
                    The gameplay of Factorio is entirely centered around the pursuit of growth. The player must collect resources, process those
                    resources into more valuable ones, use those resources to produce more efficient machines, research new technologies, and use the
                    new developments to repeat the cycle. Eventually, expanding and enhancing your production will culminate in the discovery of
                    rocketry, allowing the player to leave the planet and win the game. So, the player must increase the value of the goods extracted
                    from the land and the efficiency and scale at which they do it. In short, the player must get more stuff better, and better stuff
                    more. This perpetual growth entails an expansion of production geographically and the emission of pollution. Expansion practically
                    necessitates the eradication of the indigenous life surrounding your factory, as the aggression stoked by the pollution emitted
                    will result in continuous attacks until the nests that the indigenous attackers are coming from are destroyed. As the factory
                    emits more and more pollution, the indigenous life will get stronger and stronger. The continuous growth central to the gameplay
                    of Factorio practically demands conflict with indigenous life obstructing access to resources, a perpetually growing extraction
                    rate of resources from the land, and a reckless attitude towards polluting the environment with emissions. The need for perpetual
                    growth central to the gameplay of Factorio can also be seen in our Capitalist world, albeit from different sources. The gameplay
                    of Factorio draws attention to how those issues manifest in a global economic system, like our Capitalist one, that has a similar
                    need for perpetual growth.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Critique of Perpetual Growth</h4>
                <p>
                    To reasonably argue that Factorio’s gameplay can be understood as a critique of a society that demands perpetual growth, it must
                    first be demonstrated that our society includes substantial enough pressures to grow comparable to that of Factorio.
                    Fundamentally, growth, or the investment of money to generate a profit, is an essential feature of our Capitalist society. The
                    practice has certainly existed in the past, with traveling merchants being the best example, but in our Capitalist society, this
                    has become the cornerstone of our economic system. As James Fulcher said in his Capitalism: A Very Short Guide, using capital for
                    profit becomes Capitalism when “the whole economy becomes dependent on the investment of capital and this occurs when it is not
                    just trade that is financed in this way but production as well.” Examining now the features of our system that demand growth,
                    three are particularly notable: competition, the nature of unemployment/employment, and credit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Competition is the most classically understood contributor to the monstrous growth of our economic system. In a system where
                    nobody is “safe” and everyone is vulnerable in the market, the resulting insecurity will motivate people within the system to take
                    every measure to attain certainty and security. This means firms do whatever they can to cut costs and maximize sales. This
                    involves, among other things, firms investing capital to enhance the value of their goods and services. Making more stuff better
                    or better stuff more: growth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Related to the competitive nature of the system, another key element of the necessity of perpetual growth emerges: the nature of
                    unemployment. As a result of competition, some firms that wish to mitigate danger may cut costs by making certain jobs obsolete.
                    This creates a need for the economy to create jobs for those people, leading to new jobs or new kinds of work. From an economic
                    standpoint, if growth makes too many jobs redundant, the effective demand for products would plummet and the economy would crash.
                    Thus, a capitalist economy has to keep growing to be able to manage that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another fundamental piece of our capitalist system’s constant need for growth is the existence of credit. The analysis of credit
                    as an element of this is a rather recent development, stemming from one fundamental question initially posed by Rosa Luxemburg:
                    “Where does the money come from to enable capitalists to earn a profit and the economy to grow?” Since capitalists own everything,
                    one would think they can only get back what they put in. The answer that she came to was that the capitalists must already possess
                    that extra money. This is possible through credit, and not only that, credit is what compels it to grow. Fundamentally, credit is
                    created by firms like banks out of nothing by providing loans and overdrafts. Considering, though, that if a capitalist production
                    starts off owing money, the production will always be playing catch-up, as every loan guarantees more money later. If an entire
                    economy is in debt, it must grow to pay it back. Another exacerbating factor is the presence of interest, which increases the
                    amount of money required for the loan to be forgiven over time according to a specific rate. Considering this, it is important to
                    consider where the businesses receiving these loans are getting more money than they are putting in and how banks are receiving
                    more than they are putting out. According to Bill Blackwater, this is financed by “an expansion in effective demand overwhelmingly
                    financed by yet more credit, by banks making more loans. In effect, the banks are paying each other with yet more money they have
                    created from nothing.” As a result of the fact that the economy can only pay off the accruing interest by going into more debt, it
                    is effectively an infinite game of catch-up where the economy is constantly pushed into growth to pay an unpayable debt. To get a
                    sense of the magnitude of the debt that exists now, the world is currently in approximately $300,000,000,000,000 of debt to
                    itself. (Blackwater, article)
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, considering the nature of competition, employment, and debt in a capitalist economy, there is a symmetry between the necessity
                    of the perpetual growth of Factorio and that of a capitalist economy like ours. From here, we can examine the parallel issues
                    shown in Factorio and the real world. There are three key issues that Factorio indicates exist in a society chasing perpetual
                    growth: Imperialism borne of expansion for growth, the finite nature of resources in light of the need for perpetual growth, and
                    the environmental issues that emerge.
                </p>

                <br />

                <h4>Issues in a Growth-Driven Society</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expansion and Imperialism</li>
                    <li>Depletion of Non-Renewable Resources</li>
                    <li>Environmental Impact</li>
                </ul>

                <br />

                <h4>Expansion and Imperialism</h4>
                <p>
                    The first problem in a society subject to forces necessitating perpetual growth is expansion. More specifically, when the
                    necessity of growth requires expansion to support, it can result in many problematic practices. The most notable is the practice
                    of colonization or Imperialism. This takes form in Factorio in the expansion into regions where the indigenous population lives.
                    When players fail to extract or produce enough from the resources in the land they control, players must expand their factories
                    and gain control of other deposits of needed resources to grow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the player progresses through the game and develops the technology required to extract and process new kinds of resources, like
                    oil and uranium, which are less commonly found than ones like coal, it practically requires expansion. To be able to keep that
                    expansion up, the player is likely going to have to go on the offensive and clear out indigenous life that is living around them,
                    as the nests will keep producing more and more indigenous life that will keep attacking, especially if the region composing the
                    factory is close to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, as the factory expands, taking more indigenous land and emitting more pollution, the indigenous life is much more
                    likely to become aggressive, also pushing the player to go on the offensive and clear them out. In the real world, an economic
                    system reliant on perpetual growth has similar ramifications. This is one of the key criticisms of capitalism levied by Marxists.
                    Karl Marx argues that Imperialism and the growth inherent in capitalism are linked because of capitalism’s global nature; it is
                    impossible to limit it to specific regions of the world. Because of this, Imperialist practices (expanding a nation’s sphere of
                    control beyond its borders by taking control of land in others) emerged as a way to gain resources and raw materials relatively
                    cheaply, exploiting the indigenous peoples affected. The same thing can be seen in the way Factorio players must expand their
                    control of the indigenous land to satisfy the need for more resources based on the required growth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another consequence of imperialism that can be perceived as invoked in the gameplay of Factorio is the way that indigenous victims
                    of imperialism have historically been dehumanized. In Factorio, the indigenous life is presented as aggressive beasts that attack
                    the player as they develop their factory. However, the aggression only starts when that indigenous life is either threatened, in
                    the case that the player approaches their nests, or if the player is polluting the environment. There is a parallel here with,
                    historically, how the victims of imperialism have been dehumanized. This can be seen in the way Native Americans were deemed
                    “savages” as a way to justify their exploitation and the seizing of land they controlled. In Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of
                    the United States, a quote from Christopher Columbus reveals the intentions of the Spanish after discovering the Natives in 1492:
                    “They…brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks’
                    bells. They willingly traded everything they owned…. They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they
                    took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance…. With 50 men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we
                    want.” The desire to exploit these people for gain is evident here. As the conflicts between the Natives and settlers continued,
                    the nineteenth century saw, as anthropologist Peter Nabokov discusses in his essay Indians, Slaves, and Mass Murder: The Hidden
                    History, an attitude towards the extermination of the Natives that “was considered no great tragedy for an entire people who were
                    uniformly and irredeemably defined as savage and subhuman.” So, Factorio’s gameplay indicates that expansionism becomes necessary
                    when compelled by the need for limitless growth and that this leads to all kinds of problematic practices.
                </p>

                <br />

                <h4>Finite Resources</h4>
                <p>
                    Another issue seen in the growth-manic world of today is the depletion of non-renewable resources, which is also alluded to in
                    Factorio. In Factorio, the map is a finite space and therefore can not support limitless growth. Even logistically, once the
                    reserves of resources run out in one spot, especially ones like oil, another reserve might be very far away. As the factory grows
                    and grows, the player not only has to keep expanding and expanding, but they will also have to keep track of how many resources
                    are left in the deposits. If the game goes long enough, the player will surely run into situations where non-renewable resources
                    running out will cause them difficulty. A similar issue is present in the real world. As the global economy has continued to grow,
                    the resources of the world, specifically the non-renewable ones, are slowly running out. For instance, examining the rate at which
                    we are extracting non-renewable resources out of the ground, according to Tibi Puiu, a science journalist and co-founder of ZME
                    Science, we can use the ratio of reserves to production to determine that “at the current rates of production, oil will run out in
                    53 years, natural gas in 54, and coal in 110.” Once those resources run out, the world will have to undergo massive change to
                    adapt, considering how fundamental the use of these resources is to our day-to-day lives. Despite this, the current resource
                    production rates must continue to support growth, just as in Factorio. Thus, Factorio draws attention to the issue of finite
                    resources in a world with so much pressure to grow.

                <h4>Environmental Concerns</h4>
                <p>
                    The next key issue that Factorio draws attention to as arising in a production model so fundamentally reliant on perpetual growth
                    is an environmental one. One of the key features of Factorio is the implementation of a pollution mechanic, whereby the machines
                    that the player develops to enhance the production of their factory emits pollution into the air that slowly spreads throughout
                    the map. In Factorio, it is practically impossible for the player to avoid polluting the air, despite the possibility of not doing
                    so. It is much more efficient and enables the player to grow their factory so much faster, even though it impacts the indigenous
                    life on the planet, inviting their aggression. So, in Factorio, despite the way that the pollution negatively impacts the
                    indigenous population, an agent concerned with sustaining perpetual growth is practically forced to put the interests of growth
                    above that of the indigenous population. A similar issue has arisen in the real world. Many ecological disasters that have
                    happened and will happen are directly linked to practices that are harmful to the planet but optimal for production. The most
                    notable example of this is the looming threat of global warming. As fossil fuels are burned, carbon dioxide is continuously
                    released into the air, slowly becoming more and more concentrated in the air. The presence of these molecules in the atmosphere
                    acts as a blanket that warms the planet. This warming, the greenhouse effect, poses countless threats to fragile ecosystems across
                    the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the warming air will affect weather patterns, the consequences of which we have already begun to see in the
                    disastrous hurricanes/storms of recent years (although the worst is still, unfortunately, yet to come). Despite the massive outcry
                    and protests advocating for change, these threats have yet to be addressed meaningfully. This is because of that perpetual need
                    for growth; the need for growth requires certain practices since they are most productive/efficient, despite the ramifications.
                    So, Factorio draws attention to the problematic relationship between growth and pollution in societies with a capitalist mode of
                    production.

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    In summary, Factorio indicates several key problems associated with a mode of production so fundamentally reliant on perpetual
                    growth. The issues seen in Factorio apply to the real world because they share a fundamental, central pressure for growth. This is
                    obvious in Factorio, as it is the goal of the game to grow, but in the real world, this can be seen as a result of competition,
                    the nature of unemployment/employment, and credit.
