    I am a dedicated student who finds succeeding in the most difficult classes deeply rewarding. You can see all of my
    coursework through my transcript on the CV page (under "My Work"). My favorite classes that I have taken in my time here
    are Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Web Application Development, Statistics, and Foundations in Computer Graphics.

    I am also deeply involved in the community here. One thing that I have done in the past year that I am really proud of is
    resurrecting our Association for Computing Machinery Chapter. When I became president, we had zero funding and just 3
    people coming to the meetings: the officers. By the end of the year, I (with help from our officers) was able to get a
    strong community of about 10 members coming per meeting, develop relationships with potential employers, and secure up to
    $6000 in funding for next year. Next year, I am also going to be the vice president of our Tau Beta Pi chapter here on
    campus. I look forward to working hard and making that club great too. Side note: if you are a prospective employer who
    would be interested in starting a relationship with one of these organizations, please let me know through the 
    <a href="contact.html">contact page!</a>

                            I am a rising senior at Miami University currently studying Computer Science with a minor in Games + Simulation (Game
                            Development). I am most passionate about the field of AI with an interest in Web Development. I find the seemingly
                            limitless potential for AI to solve the world's most complicated problems so captivating and am eager to contribute
                            myself. Additionally, I find the complex problems in themselves fascinating and the work, therefore, really rewarding.
