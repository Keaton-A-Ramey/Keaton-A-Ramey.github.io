                                I have been working on this since late July/early August. This is something I have always wanted to create as Chess is
                                a long-time passion/interest of mine. When we learned the fundamentals of how engines work (minimax trees, searching
                                algorithms, alpha-beta pruning, etc.) in my AI course, I knew I had to make one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This engine is named after a friend of mine from high school. Whenever we both had free time we wouldn't say a word
                                before walking to the library and sitting at the chess board to play for as much time as we had. He beat me most of
                                the time like I am sure this engine will too when it's done.

                            <p>
                                I made this project in the Fall of 2023. This was the culmination of a semester where, in my free time, I took up
                                learning React. After learning the fundamentals through a whole host of mini-projects, I created this forum-style
                                website where users can create log in with Google accounts (thanks to Firebase), create posts, like one another's
                                posts, comment on one another's posts, and delete their own comments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most challenging part of this was implementing the comments system. While I was able to find some helpful tips for
                                creating everything else, the comments system was something that I had no help for that I made as a way to challenge
                                myself and prove to myself that I was capable and understood how to use React.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beyond that, I had never used cloud services like Firebase up to that point so that was also new for me to figure out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, I had never used TypeScript either -- I found it really useful, especially in a system like this because
                                JavaScript's usual dynamic typing can lead to a whole lot of annoying issues. In the end, this was a really cool
                                learning experience for me and made me feel not only more confident as a React developer, but also as a developer in
                                general who can pick up new technologies.

                                Here, I implemented a variety of features in an interactive Raytracing program. While this class was very difficult,
                                it was also incredibly rewarding. Seeing the graphics come together over the course of the semester as I learned how
                                to implement more and more features was so exciting.

                                Here, I implemented a Naive Bayes Classifier using an approach outlined in a paper written by Jonathan Lee of
                                University of Washington. You can read the paper
                                <a

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To do this, I wrote two different programs. The first program used a dataset from Kaggle to calculate the
                                probabilities that an email is either spam or not (ham) and go through each word that appears to calculate their
                                individual probabilities of appearing given an email is spam or ham. I then used the pickle library to save this data
                                to my computer for easy use. The second program simply grabs all of the data from the file before taking an input
                                string from the user and calculating whether or not it is likely spam.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While I learned how Naive Bayes works in class, I had a lot of fun implementing the logarithm-based approach he
                                outlines on the last page. I rewrote this program to put the data in a JSON file instead of a pkl file so that all of
                                you can play with it yourselves.

                                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and SQLite on an OpenStack server. We divided the work between the two of
                                us: Camden was responsible for the interface between the page and our database as we used his OpenStack instance
                                (users can login, save stocks to favorites, and view their favorite history).

                                My end of it included the stock dashboard itself. This includes an initial dropdown of exchanges that the user can
                                select from to view stocks. After an exchange is selected, the page populates with stocks searchable by letter. The
                                first result is displayed at the top of the screen with general information about the stock and a graph of the
                                previous 5 days's highs and lows (shown above). Lastly, I created a page that populates with cards for each of a
                                user's favorite stocks. These cards include previous highs, lows, opens, and closes, with the percent difference from
                                the day before.

                                Completed in Software Requirements. I, along with 3 other students, created a final Software Requirements
                                Specification (SRS) Document according to the IEEE830 Template for a t-shirt business looking to create an eCommerce
                                platform.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Initially, we conducted domain analysis and requirements elicitation using several techniques like brainstorming and
                                surveys.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After this was done, we moved on to analysis and specification. This invovlved modeling the system using various
                                diagrams like UML Activity Diagrams (example above) and writing a first, initial draft of the SRS according to IEEE830
                                template.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, after getting feedback from our "client" (professor) we reworked the document to be more accurate and did two
                                different requirements reviews, acting as various stakeholders. Our last assignment was a presentation to the class
                                about our process and results.

                                After developing several smaller projects and RedShout on my own, this project solidified my confidence as a React
                                developer and reinforced the concepts I had been learning on my own throughout the semester. It was very rewarding as
                                implementing everything I was responsible for felt very easy. That feeling of mastery and putting something together
                                that works quickly is one of my favorite feelings being a computer science student.

                                Completed in Systems I, as a final project I created a web app with 3 pages that used C++ in the backend to query
                                various tables in a database with SQL to obtain flight data and populate HTML tables with results. The user was able
                                to enter a variety of data into fields to customize queries. This project was interesting because it was a new way of
                                handling backend (and frontend to an extent) via CGI files but at the same time it gave me some great experience
                                solidifying the SQL I had learned over the semester along with learning about C++ web development.

                                Unfortunately, this project was done on Miami's linux servers and I did not download my work from the server before my
                                data was wiped, so I am unable to show off the site/code. However, I still wanted to mention it because it speaks to
                                some knowledge/application of SQL.

                                Through my time at Miami, I have gained expertise in Java. While I do not have any large projects worthy of their own
