                                This is a 2-semester project I am doing with 3 Electrical Engineering Students. The 
                                overall goal is to have a system where a Raspberry Pi is connected to 3 (for now)
                                cameras that transmit their image data to a central Pi. Using these 3 images, this
                                central Pi will automatically use software that I have already written (3D localization 
                                software) to accurately calculate the real-world position of the drone. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using that real-world position, this central Pi will decide on and issue instructions to the
                                drone in order to move it along a predetermined path. The end goal is to fit hyperspectral 
                                cameras to this drone in order to use its images to analyze crop health in an indoor farm.
                                These insights will be used to decide what nutrients and how much of them to give to areas
                                of crops. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To be more specific, this semester I have delivered software that does 2 main things:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Given the rough, 3-D locations of a camera and both the 3-D locations and pixel-coordinates
                                    of 5 objects in the image (we used LEDs), the software will run a least-squares optimization
                                    to very accurately calculate the location and orientation of the camera.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Given the pixel coordinates of an object that appears in multiple images that I am able to
                                    run that least-squares optimization with, I can accurately calculate the approximate 3D location
                                    of said object. This is how we'll know where the drones are. 
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                Next semester, I will be working on processes by which we can make those 2 things 
                                an automatic rather than a manual process, as I currently have to feed the program those coordinates. 
                                Additionally, I will likely be working on interfacing with the drone, writing software to control its movement.

                                This project was done over the course of a semester in CSE 432/532: Machine Learning. 
                                It focused on classifying human activities using data from four sensors: accelerometer, 
                                gyroscope, magnetometer, and pressure sensor. The data came from 100+ experiments from a dozen users, and 
                                the goal was to preprocess it, extract features, and train machine learning models to identify 
                                activities like walking, running, and typing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I started by organizing the raw sensor data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and cleaning it up. 
                                Missing values were handled using interpolation, filling techniques, and dropping any leftover columns with 
                                too many NaNs. To avoid data leakage, I split the data into training and testing groups based on users. I also 
                                standardized all features and used SMOTE to address class imbalances.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Feature extraction was a big part of this project. I split the time-series data into overlapping windows, with 
                                sizes from 100 to 500 samples and overlaps of 25% or 50%. From each window, I extracted 114 features, including 
                                things like mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. These features were consistent across both training and testing 
                                datasets. Feature selection was performed to identify the most relevant features, using mutual information and 
                                correlation analysis to reduce redundancy and improve model performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I used the selected features to train models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost. 
                                I tuned their hyperparameters with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV and evaluated them using metrics like 
                                F1 Score, Cohen's Kappa, and Precision. SVM and Random Forest performed the best in my testing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project had its challenges—things like computational limits and handling redundant features—but it taught 
                                me a lot about working with time-series data and machine learning workflows. Overall, it was a excellent learning 
                                experience and I am excited to use what I learned here in future projects.

                                I have been working on this since late July/early August. This is something I have always wanted to create as Chess is
                                a long-time passion/interest of mine. When we learned the fundamentals of how engines work (minimax trees, searching
                                algorithms, alpha-beta pruning, etc.) in my AI course, I knew I had to make one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This engine is named after a friend of mine from high school. Whenever we both had free time we wouldn't say a word
                                before walking to the library and sitting at the chess board to play for as much time as we had. He beat me most of
                                the time like I am sure this engine will too when it's done.

                                I made this project in the Fall of 2023. This was the culmination of a semester where, in my free time, I took up
                                learning React. After learning the fundamentals through a whole host of mini-projects, I created this forum-style
                                website where users can create log in with Google accounts (thanks to Firebase), create posts, like one another's
                                posts, comment on one another's posts, and delete their own comments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most challenging part of this was implementing the comments system. While I was able to find some helpful tips for
                                creating everything else, the comments system was something that I had no help for that I made as a way to challenge
                                myself and prove to myself that I was capable and understood how to use React.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beyond that, I had never used cloud services like Firebase up to that point so that was also new for me to figure out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, I had never used TypeScript either -- I found it really useful, especially in a system like this because
                                JavaScript's usual dynamic typing can lead to a whole lot of annoying issues. In the end, this was a really cool
                                learning experience for me and made me feel not only more confident as a React developer, but also as a developer in
                                general who can pick up new technologies.

                                Here, I implemented a variety of features in an interactive Raytracing program. While this class was very difficult,
                                it was also incredibly rewarding. Seeing the graphics come together over the course of the semester as I learned how
                                to implement more and more features was so exciting.

                                Here, I implemented a Naive Bayes Classifier using an approach outlined in a paper written by Jonathan Lee of
                                University of Washington. You can read the paper
                                <a
                                    href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse312/18sp/lectures/naive-bayes/naivebayesnotes.pdf"

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To do this, I wrote two different programs. The first program used a dataset from Kaggle to calculate the
                                probabilities that an email is either spam or not (ham) and go through each word that appears to calculate their
                                individual probabilities of appearing given an email is spam or ham. I then used the pickle library to save this data
                                to my computer for easy use. The second program simply grabs all of the data from the file before taking an input
                                string from the user and calculating whether or not it is likely spam.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While I learned how Naive Bayes works in class, I had a lot of fun implementing the logarithm-based approach he
                                outlines on the last page. I rewrote this program to put the data in a JSON file instead of a pkl file so that all of
                                you can play with it yourselves.

                                Completed in Web Application Development with Camden Amata, we created a stock dashboard webpage. For this, we used
                                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and SQLite on an OpenStack server. We divided the work between the two of
                                us: Camden was responsible for the interface between the page and our database as we used his OpenStack instance
                                (users can login, save stocks to favorites, and view their favorite history).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My end of it included the stock dashboard itself. This includes an initial dropdown of exchanges that the user can
                                select from to view stocks. After an exchange is selected, the page populates with stocks searchable by letter. The
                                first result is displayed at the top of the screen with general information about the stock and a graph of the
                                previous 5 days's highs and lows (shown above). Lastly, I created a page that populates with cards for each of a
                                user's favorite stocks. These cards include previous highs, lows, opens, and closes, with the percent difference from
                                the day before.

                                Completed in Software Requirements. I, along with 3 other students, created a final Software Requirements
                                Specification (SRS) Document according to the IEEE830 Template for a t-shirt business looking to create an eCommerce
                                platform.

                                Initially, we conducted domain analysis and requirements elicitation using several techniques like brainstorming and
                                surveys.
                            </p>

                                After this was done, we moved on to analysis and specification. This invovlved modeling the system using various
                                diagrams like UML Activity Diagrams (example above) and writing a first, initial draft of the SRS according to IEEE830
                                template.
                            </p>

                                Lastly, after getting feedback from our "client" (professor) we reworked the document to be more accurate and did two
                                different requirements reviews, acting as various stakeholders. Our last assignment was a presentation to the class
                                about our process and results.

                                Done with a group of 4 other students. The HiLo game was my contribution, although I pitched in at other points of the
                                site too.

                                After developing several smaller projects and RedShout on my own, this project solidified my confidence as a React
                                developer and reinforced the concepts I had been learning on my own throughout the semester. It was very rewarding as
                                implementing everything I was responsible for felt very easy. That feeling of mastery and putting something together
                                that works quickly is one of my favorite feelings being a computer science student.

                                Completed in Systems I, as a final project I created a web app with 3 pages that used C++ in the backend to query
                                various tables in a database with SQL to obtain flight data and populate HTML tables with results. The user was able
                                to enter a variety of data into fields to customize queries. This project was interesting because it was a new way of
                                handling backend (and frontend to an extent) via CGI files but at the same time it gave me some great experience
                                solidifying the SQL I had learned over the semester along with learning about C++ web development.

                                Unfortunately, this project was done on Miami's linux servers and I did not download my work from the server before my
                                data was wiped, so I am unable to show off the site/code. However, I still wanted to mention it because it speaks to
                                some knowledge/application of SQL.

                                Through my time at Miami, I have gained expertise in Java. While I do not have any large projects worthy of their own
                                cards, I still want to show you that I have a great deal of Java experience under my belt. Here are the relevant
                                courses I learned Java in:
